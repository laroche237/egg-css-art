# CSS Egg Art Project

This project demonstrates how to create a fun and artistic egg shape using pure CSS. The design includes a white egg base, a yellow yolk, and small details like eyes to make it more playful.

## Features

- Pure CSS design with no images.
- Includes creative use of `box-shadow` and `border-radius` for shapes.
 Important: the yolk couldn't work fine with chrome but it is perfect with mozilla and edge. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the .html file in your favorite browser to see the design.
